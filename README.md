# Gun-Violence-Data
This dataset is a comprehensive record of over 260,000 incidents of gun-related violence in the US from 2013-2018.
The creator originally was inspired to compile it in wake of the Parkland shooting and the ensuing mass media coverage.
Maybe knowledge of gun violence will help prevent a future school shooting. I combined different analytical approaches
to gain insights into what contributes to the death count by guns in the US.
